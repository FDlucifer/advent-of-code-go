## Summary of Days
Day | Name | Type of Algo & Notes
--- | --- | ---
1 | The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation | - Simple math problem
2 | Program Alarm | - Intro to the crazy Intcode problems that are half the AoC days... <br> - Array (slice...) manipulation <br> - I used recursion
3 | Crossed Wires | - Geometry kind of algo, finding intersections of lines on a grid
4 | Secure Container | - May appear math-y, but it's really a string manipulation problem
5 | Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids | - Yay more Intcode!........ <br> - This gave me fits... <br> - Good application for recursion (in my opinion)
6 | Universal Orbit Map | - __Tree traversal__ and depth calculations. It's not quite a Graph, but it has a __directed graph__ algo feel too
7 | Amplification Circuit | - More Intcode... Piping together multiple Intcode computers ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ <br> - Refactored Intcode computer to an OOP approach so a single computer maintains its data <br> - Also requires making __permutations generator__ <br> - Some gymnastics to make this circular, but its easier with this OOP approach and the "objects"/instances of a struct maintaining their own data
8 | Space Image Format | 3D Array manipulation
