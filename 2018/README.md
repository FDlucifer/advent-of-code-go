## Summary
Day | Name | Type of Algo & Notes
--- | --- | ---
1 | Chronal Calibration | - Pretty simple, direct math problem
2 | Inventory Management System | - Pretty simple, brute force string comparison
3 | No Matter How You Slice It | - Still pretty simple, 2D grid overlaps, simple hashmap problem
4 | Repose Record | - Not very fun data manipulation, pretty straight forward "which time does X happen most often at"
