## 2020 Event

To run days for 2020, I'm planning on using `go test -run RegExpToMatchFunctionNames .` to make it cleaner to run any given examples.
`go run main.go -part <1 or 2>` will be usable to run the actual inputs for that day

Scripts have been added to the outer folder to setup files for a particular day more easily
