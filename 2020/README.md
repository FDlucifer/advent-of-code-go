## 2020 Event

To run days for 2020, I'm planning on using `go test -run RegExpToMatchFunctionNames .` to make it cleaner to run the examples and inputs and not requiring 189203829048024 files for main packages

Scripts have also been added to the outer folder to setup files for a particular day more easily
